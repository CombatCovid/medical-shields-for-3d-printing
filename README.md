  Concerns about printed respirators
  The wearer will have the mask on their face, a humid and warm place, a perfect breeding ground for germs. We won’t be able to sterilize these masks effectively so we might be causing even more problems. And the virus reportedly survives for over 48 hours on the plastics (or even 90 hours, according to some other studies). We all want to help our friends and families which means we should be all the more precautious to keep from hurting them. If you absolutely insist on printing a mask now, treat it like it is a basic surgical mask and not as a true respirator with all the protections they provide. A false sense of security can be very dangerous. I understand you’re trying to help, but PLEASE spread this info into your 3D printing groups.

  # Title: From Design to Mass 3D printing of Medical Shields in Three Days
  
  ## Introduction
  
  In reaction to the acute shortage of protective wear for medical personnel in the current pandemic situation, we have quickly developed and started to mass-produce protective face shields. We have already printed and donated over 35.000 shields to medics and other professionals in the Czech Republic and we have requests for 120.000 more (numbers to 3rd March 2020).
  
  But the shortage is global and everyone with a 3D printer can help! 3D printing communities across the world became a massive driving force in the effort to produce protective wear for those, who need it the most.
  
  It’s not only about hospitals and other first responders like police officers and firemen, but also nursing homes, dentists, or just grocery store staff - simply put, you could offer your help to all those who now have to stay in the service or be in contact with many other people in the time of crisis.

  #### Concerns about printed respirators
  
  - None of the designs available right now have been tested to ensure they provide the protections needed, at least none of the ones I am aware of. To help with this, we have collected as many designs as we could find, and are working with experts to see if we can verify which ones really work. What are the key focus points? First, it’s the sealing, then the filter itself, the filter to the mask, and how the mask attaches to the face, it all must be perfect. Most of us print rigid materials that are hard to make compliant for seals. (by Prusa)
  - Another question we need to take into account is the porosity of the printed parts and the safety concerns that come from that. The wearer will have the mask on their face, a humid and warm place, a perfect breeding ground for germs. We won’t be able to sterilize these masks effectively so we might be causing even more problems. And the virus reportedly survives for over 48 hours on the plastics (or even 90 hours, according to some other studies). We all want to help our friends and families which means we should be all the more precautious to keep from hurting them. If you absolutely insist on printing a mask now, treat it like it is a basic surgical mask and not as a true respirator with all the protections they provide. A false sense of security can be very dangerous. I understand you’re trying to help, but PLEASE spread this info into your 3D printing groups.
