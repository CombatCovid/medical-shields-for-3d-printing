## Which tools do you need?

A 3D printer, a laser cutter, and scissors

## Which are the model files for 3d printing? 

All the model files can be found online [here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-protective-face-shield-rc1/files)

This repo has all the needed files on [the src local folder](../../src) of the CombatCovid Github area, and you can view them or download from the links there. 

If you click on the STL files, on your browser you'll get a 3D view you can manipulate, to understand the mask and its parts.
